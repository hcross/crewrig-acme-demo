# Unified Community Component Format

This document specifies the single-source format for community components
in `artifacts/community/`. Components written in this format are compiled by
`scripts/build-components.sh` into tool-specific outputs for Gemini CLI
and Claude Code.

## Principles

1. **One source file, multiple targets** — the prompt/logic content is
   written once and shared across all tools.
2. **Universal metadata** is required — `name`, `description`, `type`.
3. **Tool-specific overrides** are optional — only needed when a tool
   requires metadata beyond the universal fields.
4. **The body is never duplicated** — install scripts extract the body
   and wrap it in the target tool's format.

## Supported Component Types

| Type | Source location | Gemini CLI output | Claude Code output |
|------|----------------|-------------------|--------------------|
| `skill` | `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` | `.gemini/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` | `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` |
| `command` | `commands/<name>.md` | `.gemini/commands/<name>.toml` | `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` |
| `agent` | `agents/<name>/AGENT.md` | `.gemini/agents/<name>.md` | `.claude/agents/<name>/AGENT.md` |

Hooks, policies, and MCP servers use JSON formats and are handled
separately by the build script (merged into tool-specific config files).

## Source File Format

Every source file uses Markdown with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
# === Universal metadata (required) ===
name: my-component
description: "Brief description used for discovery and activation"
type: skill           # skill | command | agent

# === Gemini CLI overrides (optional) ===
# Only include if Gemini needs different metadata than the universal fields.
# Omit entirely to use universal defaults.
gemini:
  # No extra fields needed for most skills.
  # For commands: no overrides needed (description + body used as-is).

# === Claude Code overrides (optional) ===
# Only include if Claude Code needs extra metadata.
# Omit entirely to use universal defaults.
claude:
  allowed-tools:
    - Read
    - Write
    - Edit
    - Bash
    - Grep
    - Glob
  user-invocable: true
  # disable-model-invocation: false  # default

## Field Reference

### Universal Fields (required)

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `name` | string | Component identifier (kebab-case) |
| `description` | string | Brief description for discovery. Used by both tools. |
| `type` | string | `skill`, `command`, or `agent` |
| `metadata` | mapping | Optional container recognised by the agentskills.io spec for non-standard keys. crewrig curates `metadata.provenance` here (see [Provenance & Forks](#provenance--forks)). |

### Gemini CLI Overrides (optional)

The `gemini:` section is rarely needed. The build script uses universal
fields by default:

- For `skill`: generates a SKILL.md with `name` and `description` in
  the frontmatter, body as-is.
- For `command`: generates a `.toml` file with `description` and the
  body wrapped in `prompt = """..."""`.
- For `agent`: generates a flat `.gemini/agents/<name>.md` file with YAML
  frontmatter (`name`, `description`) — required by Gemini CLI's
  sub-agent discovery — followed by the body as the system prompt.

### Claude Code Overrides (optional)

The `claude:` section adds Claude Code-specific frontmatter fields:

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `allowed-tools` | string[] | *(none)* | Tools the skill can use |
| `user-invocable` | boolean | `true` | Can the user invoke with `/name`? |
| `disable-model-invocation` | boolean | `false` | Prevent auto-invocation? |
| `context` | string | *(none)* | Run context (`fork` for isolated subagent) |
| `agent` | string | *(none)* | Agent type (`Explore`, `Plan`, etc.) |
| `model` | string | *(none)* | Model override |
| `effort` | string | *(none)* | Effort level override |

## Build Outputs

### Skill: `artifacts/core/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`

Gemini CLI → `.gemini/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`

```yaml
---
name: <name>
description: <description>
---
<body>
```

Claude Code → `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`

```yaml
---
name: <name>
description: <description>
allowed-tools:        # from claude.allowed-tools (if present)
  - Read
  - Bash
user-invocable: true  # from claude.user-invocable (if present)
---
<body>
```

### Skill resource subfolders (`scripts/`, `references/`, `assets/`)

Per the [Agent Skills spec](https://agentskills.io/specification), a
skill may ship three optional resource subfolders alongside its
`SKILL.md`:

| Subfolder | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `scripts/` | Executable code the skill invokes (Python, Bash, JavaScript). |
| `references/` | Additional documentation loaded on demand. |
| `assets/` | Templates, fixtures, static resources. |

When present in a source under `artifacts/core/skills/<name>/`,
these subfolders are **propagated verbatim** to both build outputs
(`.gemini/skills/<name>/<subfolder>/...` and
`.claude/skills/<name>/<subfolder>/...`). Executable bits are
preserved. Skill bodies should reference resources by path relative
to the skill root (e.g. `scripts/curate.sh`), so the same invocation
works regardless of whether the skill lives at project level
(`.gemini/.claude/`) or user level (`~/.gemini/`, `~/.claude/`).

### Command: `artifacts/community/commands/<name>.md`

Gemini CLI → `.gemini/commands/<name>.toml`

```toml
description = "<description>"

prompt = """
<body>
"""
```

Claude Code → `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`

```yaml
---
name: <name>
description: <description>
user-invocable: true
---
<body>
```

### Agent: `artifacts/core/agents/<name>/AGENT.md`

Gemini CLI → `.gemini/agents/<name>.md`

```yaml
---
name: <name>
description: <description>
metadata:          # propagated when source declares metadata.provenance
  provenance:
    canonical: ...
    feedback: ...
    version: ...
---
<body — becomes the agent's system prompt>
```

Claude Code → `.claude/agents/<name>/AGENT.md`

```yaml
---
name: <name>
description: <description>
---
<body>
```

## Provenance & Forks

Components carry a `metadata.provenance:` block in their frontmatter that
survives forks and lets feedback flow back to the right repo. The block
is optional but recommended for any component intended to be re-shared.

`provenance` lives under `metadata:` to keep the root frontmatter
restricted to fields recognised by the
[agentskills.io specification](https://agentskills.io/specification)
(`name`, `description`, `license`, `compatibility`, `metadata`,
`allowed-tools`). The spec reserves `metadata:` for non-standard keys —
crewrig curates `provenance` there.

```yaml
---
name: my-component
description: "..."
type: skill
metadata:
  provenance:
    canonical: "${CANONICAL_REPO}"   # origin (audit + license trace)
    feedback:  "${FEEDBACK_REPO}"    # MR target (defaults to canonical)
    version:   "1.0.0"               # version at build/import
---
```

### Placeholder resolution

`${SHELL_LIKE}` placeholders are resolved at **build time** by
`scripts/build-components.sh` from `crewrig.config.toml` at the repo
root. Each line in the config file maps an uppercased key to a value:

```toml
canonical_repo = "https://github.com/crewrig/crewrig"
feedback_repo  = "https://github.com/crewrig/crewrig"
```

The build substitutes every `${KEY}` placeholder it encounters in the
generated outputs (`.gemini/`, `.claude/`) — frontmatter **and** body —
not only inside the `metadata.provenance:` block. This is intentional:
components may reference `${CANONICAL_REPO}` or other config keys in
their prompt body too. Source files keep the placeholders untouched.

### Forking workflow

When you fork crewrig (or a fork of it):

1. Edit `crewrig.config.toml` to point at your URLs. Typically:
   - Keep `canonical_repo` pointing at the upstream you forked from
     (audit trail).
   - Set `feedback_repo` to your own repo so harness feedback lands
     internally.
2. Run `task build-components` to regenerate the outputs with your
   values.
3. Commit both `crewrig.config.toml` and the regenerated outputs.

The `version:` field in `metadata.provenance:` is a literal
per-component string, not a placeholder. It tracks the component's own
evolution independently from the host repo.

### Version semantics (SemVer)

The `metadata.provenance.version` field follows
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)
(`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`):

| Bump | When |
|---|---|
| **PATCH** (`1.0.0 → 1.0.1`) | Friction-driven fix or wording change. The skill's contract is unchanged; an agent following `1.0.0` and an agent following `1.0.1` produce equivalent output. Most curator-driven fixes are PATCH. |
| **MINOR** (`1.0.1 → 1.1.0`) | Additive change. New section, new recognition signal, new payload field, new optional behaviour. Backward-compatible — agents following `1.0.x` keep working unchanged. |
| **MAJOR** (`1.1.0 → 2.0.0`) | Breaking contract change. Removed payload fields, renamed required fields, semantics flip. Forks pinning `1.x` need to migrate consciously. |

**Bump rule.** Every PR that touches a `SKILL.md` or `AGENT.md`
source under `artifacts/community/` MUST bump `metadata.provenance.version`
in the same diff. CI enforces this via `scripts/check-skill-versions.sh`
(see `task check-skill-versions` for the local invocation). The
rationale:

- A friction tag captured `evidence: <path>:<line>` against an
  unspecified version drifts silently once the source changes. The
  version pins the contract observed at tag time.
- Forks that install at user level (`~/.gemini/`, `~/.claude/`) need
  a signal to re-pull. A version field with no bump = no signal.
- Maintainers triaging `harness-feedback` issues can compare the
  friction's observed version against the current canonical version
  and immediately see whether the friction has already been fixed.

The bump goes in the same PR as the change. A "version-only bump" PR
is not a thing — it always accompanies a content edit.

### Components without a `metadata.provenance:` block

Components shipped before the provenance contract existed (or
intentionally unscoped) build unchanged — the resolver only acts on
content that actually contains placeholders. There is no automatic
backfill.

## Parser Requirements

The build script (`scripts/build-components.sh`) requires:

- **`yq`** (preferred) for YAML frontmatter parsing, or a lightweight
  Python helper as fallback.
- **`jq`** for JSON merging (hooks, policies, MCP servers).
- **Bash 4+** for associative arrays and advanced string handling.

## Validation Rules

1. Every source file MUST have `name`, `description`, and `type` in
   the frontmatter.
2. The `type` field MUST be one of: `skill`, `command`, `agent`.
3. The body (content after the closing `---`) MUST NOT be empty.
4. Tool-specific sections (`gemini:`, `claude:`) are optional.
5. Unknown fields in tool-specific sections are silently ignored.
