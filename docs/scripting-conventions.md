# Scripting Conventions

Bash and Python glue scripts under `scripts/` and `hooks/` follow these rules.
The list is short on purpose: each rule comes from a real production incident
where a script silently misbehaved for weeks. If you have a real reason to
break a rule, mark the line with `# acknowledged-exception: <reason>` so the
exception is greppable.

---

## Rule 1 — No broad or bare `except` in Python glue

A `try` block must catch the narrowest exception that justifies the recovery
path. Bare `except:`, `except Exception:`, and `except BaseException:` are
banned because they silently swallow `ImportError`, `KeyboardInterrupt`,
`SystemExit`, and unrelated runtime bugs.

### Why

The session-transcript hook (`hooks/mempalace-transcript.sh`) silently
dropped every entry for **months** after the MemPalace v3.x upgrade. A broad
`except` was hiding an `ImportError` for a class that no longer existed
(`PalaceGraph`). The fix landed in `1429cdb`; this rule exists so the
failure mode does not return.

### Bad

```python
try:
    from mempalace.mcp_server import tool_add_drawer
    result = tool_add_drawer(...)
except:
    pass  # never know what failed
```

### Good

```python
try:
    from mempalace.mcp_server import tool_add_drawer
except ImportError as e:
    print(f"IMPORT_ERROR: {e}", file=sys.stderr)
    sys.exit(2)

result = tool_add_drawer(...)
if not result.get("success"):
    print(f"ADD_FAILED: {result.get('error', 'unknown')}", file=sys.stderr)
    sys.exit(3)
```

If continuing past a failure is genuinely correct, surface it:

```python
try:
    drawer_dt = datetime.strptime(date_str, "%Y-%m-%d")
except ValueError:
    stats["skipped_format"] += 1   # counted, not silent
    continue
```

If `stats["skipped_format"] == total_scanned`, escalate — that means the
recovery path is masking a structural assumption error.

---

## Rule 2 — No success-log-before-result

A log line that says "did X" must be guarded by the actual outcome of X.
Logs that fire regardless of the underlying call's exit status produce
months of "looks fine" with zero data flowing.

### Why

The transcript hook printed `mempalace-transcript: persisted ...` to stderr
on **every** invocation, including the ones where the underlying Python
heredoc had crashed during import. The success line lived outside the
return-code check that gated it. PR #31 / commit `1429cdb`.

### Bad

```bash
"$MEMPALACE_PYTHON" - <<PYEOF
... # may exit non-zero
PYEOF
echo "persisted entry"  # fires regardless
```

### Good

```bash
STATUS=$("$MEMPALACE_PYTHON" - 2>&1 <<'PYEOF'
... # may exit non-zero
PYEOF
)
STATUS_RC=$?
if [ "$STATUS_RC" -eq 0 ]; then
  echo "persisted entry"
else
  echo "FAILED to persist (rc=$STATUS_RC): $STATUS" >&2
fi
```

The principle generalizes: the log line must be on the success branch of an
`if` that read the actual result.

---

## Rule 3 — No `[ test ] && cmd && exit N` under `set -e`

Use an explicit `if … then … fi` block. The chained-test pattern looks like
a one-line guard, but under `set -e` it kills the script on the **success**
path: when the test is false, the compound returns non-zero, and `set -e`
aborts before the next intended statement. The script appears to fail
silently on every successful run.

### Why

Surfaced in commit `212318c`:

> The pattern `[ -z "$FOUND" ] && echo "..." && exit 1` would kill the
> script via `set -e` whenever FOUND was set (i.e., on every successful
> install), because the negated test returns non-zero.

The trap repeats itself across files because the one-liner is shorter than
the `if` block. It is shorter; it is also wrong.

### Bad

```bash
set -e
[ ! -d "$REPO_DIR/extensions/$EXT" ] && echo "Error: extension '$EXT' not found." && exit 1
do_install "$EXT"
```

### Good

```bash
set -e
if [ ! -d "$REPO_DIR/extensions/$EXT" ]; then
  echo "Error: extension '$EXT' not found." >&2
  exit 1
fi
do_install "$EXT"
```

The explicit `if` block makes the failure path unambiguous and the success
path immune to the `set -e` trap. Send the error to `>&2` while you are
there.

A single-`&&` form (`[[ ! cond ]] && exit 1`) is the same family in lighter
form and gets the same treatment.

## Rule 4 — Defense-in-depth checks must verify their inputs

When a check fires only on a partial view of its input, the check passing
is not the same as the underlying invariant being true. Make checks
*independently verifiable* — surface the size of the input they actually
saw, so the next reader can spot a wedge upstream.

### Why

PR #39 (`scripts/prune-transcripts.sh`) shipped a pagination loop whose
termination condition (`count <= offset + len(drawers)`) misread the API
contract and exited after the first page. The script had a perfectly
correct format-mismatch escalation that fired on the 100 drawers it saw,
hiding the fact that 11 850 of 11 850 drawers in the wing had not been
scanned. Two review cycles missed the upstream wedge because the
downstream check kept producing an actionable error.

### Bad

```python
# Pagination loop: imagine it terminates after the first page (broken
# upstream — only 100 of 11 850 drawers scanned).
for drawer in drawers_seen_so_far:
    if not matches_format(drawer):
        skipped_format += 1

# This downstream check fires on the partial sample and looks correct.
# The user sees an actionable error message and concludes the script
# worked. The 11 750 unscanned drawers stay invisible — the wedge
# upstream is hidden because the downstream check refused to look past
# the slice it was handed.
if skipped_format == len(drawers_seen_so_far):
    sys.exit(3)  # silent on input size — silent on the wedge
```

### Good

```python
# Surface what was actually scanned, so a wedge upstream is visible.
# A reviewer comparing "Scanned: 100" against an expected wing size of
# ~10 000 catches the upstream pagination bug at a glance.
print(f"Scanned: {stats['total_scanned']} drawer(s)")
print(f"Format mismatch: {stats['skipped_format']}")
if stats["skipped_format"] == stats["total_scanned"] > 0:
    print("Error: 100% format mismatch on a sample of "
          f"{stats['total_scanned']} drawer(s).", file=sys.stderr)
    sys.exit(3)
```

A reviewer comparing "Scanned: 100" against an expected wing size of
~10 000 catches the upstream bug at a glance.

---

## Acknowledged exceptions

If a real reason justifies breaking one of these rules (e.g. a third-party
library that requires a bare `except`), tag the line:

```bash
# acknowledged-exception: vendored library raises bare strings, not exceptions
[ -f "$marker" ] && load_legacy "$marker" && exit 0
```

```python
# acknowledged-exception: aiohttp 3.x raises CancelledError as bare except path
try:
    await client.fetch(url)
except:  # noqa: E722
    cleanup()
    raise
```

The tag is greppable, so the exception is auditable. New tags should be
discussed in the PR.

---

## CI grep check

`.github/workflows/scripting-conventions.yml` runs a small `grep` pass on
`scripts/` and `hooks/` to flag new occurrences of the chained-test pattern
and bare `except`. The check is intentionally lightweight; it does not try
to be a full linter. False positives are handled with the
`acknowledged-exception` tag.
