# Tester

Tests exist to catch regressions and to document behaviour, not to
inflate a coverage number. Bias toward fewer, sharper tests.

## When to activate

- A feature is being added and the project's convention requires tests.
- A bug fix lacks a regression test.
- The user asks for a test plan or edge-case enumeration.
- A diff is up for review and you suspect under-tested behaviour.

If the project has no test infrastructure and the user has not asked
for one, do not invent one — say so and move on.

## Operating mode

### 1. Identify the unit of behaviour

Pick the smallest *observable* behaviour to test, not the smallest
*function*. A function with no observable contract has nothing to
test. A file-level helper called only from one place is best tested
through the caller.

### 2. Golden path + edge cases (not exhaustively)

For each behaviour, plan:

- **One golden-path test** that exercises the success case.
- **One or two edge-case tests** for the failure modes that matter.
- **A regression test** if the test was triggered by a bug fix —
  named so it is obvious which bug it guards.

Edge cases to consider, in this order of priority:

1. Empty / null / zero-length input.
2. Boundary values (off-by-one, overflow, encoding edges).
3. Known-bad input (malformed, adversarial — see security skill).
4. Concurrent / repeated invocations if the surface is stateful.
5. Partial failure (network mid-call, disk full, signal interrupt).

Stop adding cases when the marginal case becomes contrived. Coverage
of contrived cases costs maintenance forever.

### 3. Real dependencies where it matters

For integration tests:

- Hit a real database when the project's convention is integration
  testing (use Testcontainers, Docker Compose, or the project's
  scaffold). Mocked DB tests have a known failure mode where they
  pass while the real schema is broken.
- Mock an external API only when its calls are non-deterministic, slow,
  or rate-limited. Otherwise prefer a recorded fixture (VCR-style).

If the project has explicit guidance ("don't mock the database"),
follow it without rediscovering the lesson.

### 4. Test naming and structure

Name tests by behaviour, not by function:

```text
✓ test_login_with_valid_credentials_returns_session_token
✗ test_login_function
```

Structure each test as **arrange / act / assert**, with a blank line
between each phase. Multi-assertion tests are fine when the assertions
together describe one behaviour; split when they describe two.

### 5. Verifying a fix

When the trigger is a bug fix:

1. Write the test *first*. Run it. Confirm it fails for the *right*
   reason — not a setup error.
2. Apply the fix.
3. Run the test. Confirm it passes.
4. Run the rest of the suite to detect regressions in unrelated areas.

A test that never failed before the fix proves nothing.

## Output expectations

- Tests committed alongside the change they cover, never in a separate
  PR (unless the project explicitly batches test PRs).
- A one-line comment above each test stating the *why* — the behaviour
  being asserted — only when the test name alone is not self-evident.
- Test data inline when small; in fixtures when reused or large.

## Friction reporting

When a recognition signal fires (see `config/TOOLS.md` →
*Friction Reporting → Recognition signals*), invoke the
`harness-report` skill rather than reimplementing the protocol
inline. The reporter walks you through identifying the offender,
picking the room, and filling the payload.
