# Organization Agent Rules

<!--
  This file is the org-owned extension point for agent working rules
  (spec 0020). The adopting organization authors its additional rules HERE,
  never by editing the upstream-owned AGENTS.md.

  How org rules reach each CLI:

  - Claude Code   — natively. AGENTS.md ends with an `@AGENTS.org.md` import
                    directive; Claude resolves `@file` includes recursively
                    (CLAUDE.md -> @AGENTS.md -> @AGENTS.org.md).
  - Gemini CLI    — via setup. `scripts/setup-gemini-interactive.sh` deploys
                    this file to `~/.gemini/66_ORG_RULES.md` (priority 66,
                    after 65 org-tools). Gemini resolves `@file` imports only
                    in GEMINI.md, which this repo has no root copy of.
  - Copilot CLI   — via setup. `scripts/setup-copilot-interactive.sh` deploys
                    this file to `~/.copilot/instructions/66-org-rules.instructions.md`.
                    Copilot does not resolve `@file` includes in instruction
                    files and auto-reads only the standard `AGENTS.md` name.

  The Gemini and Copilot copies are taken at setup time. If you edit this
  file, re-run the corresponding setup script to refresh the deployed copy.

  Replace the example rules below with your organization's own.

This document holds rules specific to the adopting organization. It loads
alongside the upstream `AGENTS.md` on every supported CLI.

## Example

> Replace this section with your organization's rules. For instance:
>
> - Internal issue tracker prefix and linking convention.
> - Organization-specific review or approval requirements.
> - Naming or branching conventions that extend the upstream defaults.
