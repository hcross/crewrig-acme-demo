# CrewRig

CrewRig is a centralized configuration framework for
[Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) and
[Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code). It serves three complementary
purposes:

- **Personal context layer** — layered configuration files shape how AI
  assistants behave for a specific user's role, team, and seniority.
- **Shared innovation zone** — `community-config/` is a collaborative
  sandbox where a team builds and shares skills, agents, and commands
  that any member can install from a single source.
- **Harness engineering** — a built-in feedback loop lets agents tag
  frictions encountered during real work; the harness curator clusters
  those frictions into actionable GitHub issues, closing the loop
  between AI behavior and continuous improvement.

CrewRig develops itself using its own mechanics. The internal agent crew
— architect, developer, tester, pr-logbook, and pr-reviewer — runs on
the same skills and agents that ship with the framework. The development
workflow is the product in action.

## Supported Platforms

| Platform | Config Target | Setup Command |
|----------|---------------|---------------|
| [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) | `~/.gemini/` | `task setup-gemini-interactive` |
| [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) | `~/.claude/rules/` | `task setup-claude-interactive` |

Both platforms share the same source configuration files in `config/`.
Setup scripts deploy them into platform-specific directories.

## How It Works

### Layered Context

Configuration files are organized by priority. Each file addresses a
specific concern (identity, policies, expertise, etc.) and they combine
to form the agent's full context:

| Priority | Source | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| 00 | `config/SOUL.md` | Agent identity and values |
| 10 | `config/level/<LEVEL>.md` | Seniority-adapted guidance |
| 20 | `config/ORGANIZATION.md` | Company-wide policies |
| 30 | `config/PROFILE.md` | Personal information |
| 40 | `config/expertise/<ROLE>.md` | Technical specialization |
| 50 | `config/teams/<TEAM>.md` | Team practices and norms |
| 60 | `config/TOOLS.md` | Memory architecture and MCP servers |

**Gemini CLI** loads these via numeric-prefix files in `~/.gemini/` with
enforced priority order. **Claude Code** loads them from `~/.claude/rules/`
as additive context (all files combine, no override).

### Community Config Zone

`community-config/` is a single-source sandbox where skills, agents, and
commands are written **once** and compiled into outputs for both CLIs.
Contributors edit a single Markdown file with YAML frontmatter; the
build step produces Gemini and Claude Code targets.

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
| Skill | Reusable agent behaviour activated via `/skill-name` |
| Command | Slash command with a prompt body |
| Agent | Sub-agent with a dedicated persona |
| Hook | Lifecycle hook (BeforeTool/AfterTool/etc.) |
| Policy | Security or behavioural constraint |
| MCP Server | External tool integration |
| Theme | UI theme fragment |

Install a component on a project:

```bash
# Gemini CLI
task install-component TYPE=skills NAME=my-skill

# Claude Code
task install-claude-component TYPE=claude-skills NAME=my-skill
```

See [`community-config/FORMAT.md`](community-config/FORMAT.md) for the
full unified-source specification.

### Harness Engineering Loop

The harness turns real-world frictions into shipped improvements through
a four-stage loop:

1. **Tag** — during real work, agents invoke the `harness-report` skill
   the moment a friction signal fires (user pushback, tool surprise,
   process gap). Each tag lands in the MemPalace `harness-friction`
   wing.
2. **Cluster** — `task harness-curate -- --apply` clusters the tagged
   frictions by subcategory and opens one descriptive GitHub issue per
   cluster.
3. **Fix** — issues are addressed via the normal branch/PR workflow;
   the internal agent crew handles the implementation cycle.
4. **Re-install** — after a fix ships, run `task build-components` and
   reinstall. The `metadata.provenance.version` bump in every modified
   `SKILL.md` signals that a new version is available.

For automated periodic sweeps,
`community-config/skills/harness-curator/scripts/schedule-curator.sh`
installs a macOS launchd job or a Linux crontab entry that runs the
curator on a fixed cadence.

### Security: Copy by Default

Context files are **copied** (not symlinked) to the target directory by
default. This prevents context poisoning from malicious branches. Symlink
mode is available for development only (with a security disclaimer).

### Memory Architecture

The framework implements a three-tier memory model:

| Tier | System | Role | Access |
|------|--------|------|--------|
| 1 | Sequential Thinking | Working memory (ephemeral) | Session only |
| 2 | MemPalace | Agent memory (persistent) | Read/write, cross-tool |
| 3 | Obsidian | User knowledge (Second Brain) | Read free, write user-controlled |

See `config/TOOLS.md` for the full memory protocol.

## Lifecycle Scenario

A complete journey, from installing the framework to closing the
harness loop:

1. **Install** — fork crewrig, then run
   `task setup-claude-interactive` (or `task setup-gemini-interactive`).
   Generate your profile with `/init-personal-profile` and your soul
   with `/init-soul`.
2. **Create** — add a `SKILL.md` to
   `community-config/skills/my-skill/`, or run
   `task create-extension NAME=my-skill`. Run `task build-components`
   to generate outputs for both CLIs.
3. **Use on another project** — install the component:
   `task install-claude-component TYPE=claude-skills NAME=my-skill`.
   The skill is now available in Claude Code on that project.
4. **Record frictions** — as agents use the skill, they invoke the
   `harness-report` skill the moment a recognition signal fires. Each
   friction tag lands in the MemPalace `harness-friction` wing.
5. **Transform frictions into tickets** — run
   `task harness-curate -- --apply`. The curator clusters the
   frictions and opens one GitHub issue per cluster against the
   target repo.
6. **Implement** — address the issues via feature branches. The
   internal agent crew (architect → developer → tester → pr-logbook →
   pr-reviewer) handles the cycle.
7. **Install the new version** — run `task build-components` and
   reinstall; `metadata.provenance.version` bumps confirm which
   components changed.
8. **Back to step 3** — use the improved skill on your projects; the
   harness loop continues.

## Quick Start

### Gemini CLI

```bash
git clone git@github.com:crewrig/crewrig.git
cd crewrig

# Generate your personal profile
gemini "/init-personal-profile"

# Customize the agent identity
gemini "/init-soul"

# Run the interactive setup (deploys to ~/.gemini/)
task setup-gemini-interactive
```

### Claude Code

```bash
git clone git@github.com:crewrig/crewrig.git
cd crewrig

# Generate your personal profile
claude /init-personal-profile

# Customize the agent identity
claude /init-soul

# Run the interactive setup (deploys to ~/.claude/rules/)
task setup-claude-interactive
```

### What happens step by step

1. **`/init-personal-profile`** walks you through an interview to
   generate `config/PROFILE.md` with your identity, tooling preferences,
   projects, and working philosophy.
2. **`/init-soul`** lets you customize the agent's personality by
   refining the `config/SOUL.md` template section by section.
3. **`task setup-*-interactive`** copies shared configuration files to
   the target directory, then prompts you to select your **team**,
   **expertise**, and **experience level** via an interactive menu with
   live preview.

### Community Config (optional)

The `community-config/` directory is a collaborative sandbox for
lightweight, prompt-based components. Single-source files generate
outputs for both tools:

**Gemini CLI:**

```bash
task install-workspace
task install-component TYPE=skills NAME=my-skill
```

**Claude Code:**

```bash
task install-claude-workspace
task install-claude-component TYPE=claude-skills NAME=my-skill
```

**Build from source:**

```bash
task build-components           # Both tools
task build-components-gemini    # Gemini only
task build-components-claude    # Claude Code only
task check-components           # Drift detection (CI)
```

### Extensions (optional)

Extensions are code-based capabilities (TypeScript MCP servers) packaged
as independent npm modules. From a single `extension.json` manifest,
install scripts generate both Gemini extensions and Claude Code plugins:

**Gemini CLI:**

```bash
task install-deps
task install-extensions
task install-extension EXT=hello-world
```

**Claude Code:**

```bash
task install-deps
task build-claude-plugin EXT=hello-world
task install-claude-plugin EXT=hello-world
```

See `extensions/hello-world/` for a complete example,
`extension-skeleton/EXTENSION-FORMAT.md` for the manifest specification,
and `extension-skeleton/` as a starting template.

## MCP Servers

### Gemini CLI (`config/gemini/settings.json`)

- **GitHub** — GitHub MCP server via OAuth.
- **MemPalace** — Unified agent memory (replaces KG Memory + Deep Memory).
- **Sequential Thinking** — Working memory for structured reasoning.

### Claude Code (`~/.claude.json`, managed by `claude mcp add`)

Claude Code reads MCP servers from `~/.claude.json`, not from any `mcp.json`
file. The `setup-claude-interactive.sh` script registers them via
`claude mcp add --scope user`. To inspect or manage them later:

```bash
claude mcp list                      # Show registered servers
claude mcp add --scope user <name> -- <command> [args...]
claude mcp remove <name>
```

- **Sequential Thinking** — Working memory; registered as user-scope.
- **MemPalace** — Persistent agent memory; registered as user-scope (the
  setup script auto-detects the right Python interpreter and verifies the
  installed version is within the supported range `>=3.3.3,<3.4`). Install
  or upgrade with `task install-mempalace` (or
  `pipx install --force 'mempalace>=3.3.3,<3.4'`).
- **GitHub** — Available via Claude Code's built-in connectors.
