# check-skill-versions.sh — Enforce the version-bump rule on skill sources.
#
# Per community-config/FORMAT.md → Version semantics, every PR that touches
# a `community-config/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` or
# `community-config/agents/<name>/AGENT.md` source MUST bump
# `metadata.provenance.version` in the same diff. This script enforces the
# rule.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/check-skill-versions.sh [<base-ref>]
#
# Default base ref: origin/main. CI passes BASE_REF env var
# pointing at the PR's *target* branch (`base.ref` in GitHub Actions
# context) — NOT the PR's source/head branch. The guard diffs the PR
# against what it's about to merge into, so changes that haven't yet
# landed in the base are subject to the bump rule.
#
# Exits 0 if all changed sources include a version bump, non-zero (with a
# per-file failure list) otherwise.
