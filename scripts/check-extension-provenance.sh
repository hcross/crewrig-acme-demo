# check-extension-provenance.sh — Enforce extension provenance presence + routing.
#
# Per spec 0043 (extension-provenance-routing): every skill and agent shipped
# inside an UPSTREAM-OWNED extension tier MUST carry a self-contained
# `metadata.provenance` block (canonical / feedback / version), so a friction
# tagged against it while installed routes to the extension's OWN origin
# repository rather than to whichever project installed it.
#
# Carrier — HTML COMMENT, not frontmatter.
# Extension skills/agents are consumed IN PLACE with no render seam:
# `install-extension.sh` does `ln -s` / `cp -rf` of the whole extension dir,
# `link-extensions.sh` calls it, and `build-claude-plugin.sh` does `cp -r` of
# the skill dir — so Gemini and Claude read the SAME source bytes of SKILL.md /
# AGENT.md. Because Gemini CLI 0.42.0+ rejects any frontmatter key outside
# `name` / `description` (cli-matrix row 4b, issue #54), the provenance CANNOT
# ride in frontmatter on an in-place source. It rides instead on the HTML-comment
# carrier mandated by spec 0042 R5 and emitted by `gemini_provenance_comment`:
#
#   <!-- crewrig-provenance: version="…" canonical="…" feedback="…" -->
#
# placed as the FIRST BODY LINE (immediately after the frontmatter close),
# matching the shipped Gemini-agent contract pinned by
# `scripts/tests/test-gemini-agent-frontmatter.sh`.
#
# WHY A DEDICATED GUARD — no defense-in-depth with check-feedback-routing.sh.
# `scripts/check-feedback-routing.sh` (spec 0030) reads `metadata.provenance`
# from FRONTMATTER via `yq`. The greeter's provenance lives in a body COMMENT,
# NOT in frontmatter, so check-feedback-routing.sh's `has("provenance")`
# frontmatter test will SKIP the greeter forever — by design. That means R5
# (feedback == canonical) enforcement for extension skills/agents lives SOLELY
# here; there is no overlap with the spec-0030 guard backstopping it. State it
# plainly so a future reader does not assume the 0030 guard covers extensions.
#
# Upstream-owned tiers checked: extensions/core, extensions/library.
# Adopter-owned extensions/org is EXEMPT (consistent with the sibling guards):
# adopters own their tier and route feedback to their own configured repo.
#
# Failure conditions (per offender):
#   - missing carrier        — no `<!-- crewrig-provenance: … -->` first body line (R7 presence)
#   - incomplete fields      — carrier lacks version / canonical / feedback     (R1 completeness)
#   - feedback != canonical  — routing diverges from origin                     (R5 invariant)
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/check-extension-provenance.sh
#
# Exits 0 when every upstream-owned extension skill/agent carries a complete,
# self-routing provenance carrier; non-zero (with a per-offender list)
# otherwise. The check is static (not diff-based): it validates the whole tree
# on every run, so it is safe on both `push` and `pull_request`.
