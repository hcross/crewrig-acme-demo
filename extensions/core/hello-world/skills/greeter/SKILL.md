# Greeter Skill

When the user requests a formal introduction or greeting:

1. Determine their name (ask if unknown).
2. Call the `greet` tool from the hello-world MCP server with their name.
3. If the tool is unavailable, respond with a plain text greeting instead.

When the user wants to say goodbye:

1. Call the `farewell` tool with their name.
2. If the tool is unavailable, respond with a plain text farewell instead.
